# semiote
A reimplementation of the original Semiote automation framework, but....better

Several years ago I had a build/test/release/deploy automation framework called Semiote.

This is a reimplementation of the concepts that Semiote held.


Semiote is written in Java (17).  So if you don't like that, don't use it.

Semiote is a Vert.x application.  If you don't like doing Vert.x, don't use it.

Semiote is designed to have very separate concerns that work in a processing ring.  So if that bothers you, don't use it.
